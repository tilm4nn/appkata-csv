This project shows my work on the [CSV Viewer Agility Kata](https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/#cd8) by the clean code developer school of Ralf Westphal.

The kata is perfomed using Flow Desing / Event Based Components (EBC) and the Java programming language. It makes use of my open source Java API [EBC4J](http://object-zoo.net/ebc4j) and thus can be seen as an example application for EBC4J.

It is open source software released under the terms of the MIT License found in
the file "LICENSE.txt"

### Documentation

The documentation of the implemented iterations can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/tilm4nn/appkata-csv/wiki)
